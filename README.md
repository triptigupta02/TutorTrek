# Abstract 
With the speedy revolution of technology the education has revolutionized but this
revolution also led to a lot of competition among students. Now due to society or
any other pressure students are in the process of cramming up the things and not
able to actually get the essence of the subject and nurture their creativity. If a
student has a spark for a subject it gets compressed.
This project aims to develop an edtech mentoring platform to connect those
students with their immediate mentors who have their seniors in the same career
vision and have gone through the same state so they can relate better and can not
just teach them academics but can open up more with students. This way the
passion for the subject and creativity will be nurtured and students will be able to
accomplish goals and careers while taking care of their mental health. The
immediate mentors will also be connected with their own immediate mentors
forming a hierarchy chain.To implement this solution we are coming up with
MERN stack technology to build an online edtech mentoring platform which will
be robust, scalable, flexible, and secure. Using MongoDB as a NOSQL database,
React and Node.js, all these platforms will be scalable, flexible and secure.
<br>
A user-friendly interface that is easy for both students and mentors to use.
<br>
● A secure system for storing student and mentor data.
<br>
● A variety of communication tools so that students and mentors can easily
connect with each other.
<br>
● A system for tracking student progress so that mentors can provide timely
feedback.

# Introduction
The education system has undergone a major transformation in recent years, thanks
to the rapid advancement of technology. This has led to a lot of competition among
students, who are now under pressure to cram up information and score high
marks. However, this has also led to a decline in creativity and passion for
learning.
This project aims to develop an EdTech mentoring platform that will connect
students with their immediate mentors who have gone through the same career path
and can relate to them better[3]. This will help students to nurture their passion for
learning and achieve their academic and professional goals.
The platform will be beneficial for both students and mentors. Students will be able
to get personalized guidance from their mentors, which will help them to achieve
their academic and professional goals. Mentors will be able to share their
knowledge and experience with students, which will help them to give back to the
community.

# Problem Statement
With the high competition of jobs and careers, students are not able to make a
profession out of their passion or interest due to lack of a roadmap to the goal and
lack of connectivity to the right mentor who are on the same career path to nurture
their passion for their dream and guide them along their journey of education and
learning.

# Literature Review
The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for developing web applications. It
consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL
database, Express is a web framework, React is a JavaScript library for building
user interfaces, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment.

The development of an EdTech mentoring platform on the MERN stack is a
complex project, but it is one that has the potential to make a significant impact on
the lives of learners. By providing access to experienced mentors, EdTech
mentoring platforms can help learners to achieve their academic and professional
goals.
